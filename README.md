> The opposite of this, though! The speed differences may be negligible, but if you follow along with this article's comments, a point I agree with is raised - using single vs double quotes helps convey additional information when you or someone else has to sight-read your code.

> The opposite of this, too! Littering your codebase with unnecessary, convention-fearing classes doesn't sound like a great idea to me, especially when changing to a `has_many :through` association later down the road is incredibly trivial - and when using a join model carries performance implications!
